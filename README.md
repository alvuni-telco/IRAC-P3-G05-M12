DASH Practice 3 â€“ Advanced Adaptive Streaming Web Client
Overview
This repository contains the source code and resources for Practice 3: DASH from the "Integration of Networks, Applications and Contents" course. The main objective of this project is to develop a complete adaptive video streaming workflow using MPEG-DASH, including video preparation, streaming server setup, DRM management, and advanced real-time metrics visualization in a web client.

Practice Description
This project is organized into four main parts, following the structure described in the practice statement:

DASH.js Introduction: Deploy a basic DASH.js web client to play adaptive video from a provided MPD manifest.

Video Preparation & Basic Metrics: Encode a source video into multiple qualities, segment and package it for DASH, and visualize basic streaming metrics (bitrate, buffer, representation).

DRM Management: Encrypt the DASH segments using ClearKey DRM and adapt the client to support protected playback.

Advanced Metrics Visualization: Extend the web client to display real-time DASH metrics using Chart.js, including buffer level and bitrate, with dual-axis line charts that update dynamically as the video plays and adapts.

FILES INCLUDED IN THE REPO:
- index3-final.html: final index used containing all parts of the practice.
